# Getting Started

In this exercise we will build a solution diagram based on a real example. For our exercise the focus is on how to build the solution diagram. If you are interested in the details about what is shown in detail we recommend the session XP262.

In the end the solution diagram we are building in this exercise should look similar to this:

To allow you to build the solution diagrams more easily we have prepared for you several libraries that should be importet into draw.io before started the exercises.
Furthermore we recommend at least skimming the guidelines to get a better understanding on how to build compliant and consistent solution diagrams.

## Preparing draw.io

1.	Open draw.io - for this exercise we will use the Web client (http://draw.io).
If you haven't used draw.io before the screen might look like this:

2. Click on "Create New Diagram". A new window should open:
<br>![](/exercises/ex0/images/Ex00_03.png)
3. Choose "Blank Diagram" from the offered list and give your diagram a name that works for you (in our case "TechEd2023_TaskCenter_Example.drawio). Click on "Create".
4. Note: Depending on the storage you are using different windows might open. We chose to store our diagrams on our local device. In this case a file dialog opens in which we have to decide where we want to store our diagram and what the local filename should be. If you haven't chosen a default storage yet you might encounter the following window during the process:

5. Prepare the import of the "Sneak Preview" libraries for SAP TechEd 2023. To do so you first need to download the libraries provided here:<br>[SAP_Service_Icons_TechEd2023](/exercises/ex0/libraries/SAP_Service_Icons_TechEd2023.drawio) - Basic Service Icons for SAP BTP<br>[SAP_Generic_Icons_TechEd2023](/exercises/ex0/libraries/SAP_Generic_Icons_TechEd2023.drawio) - Generic Icons to represent entities such as databases, etc. in your solution diagram <br>[SAP_Arrows_TechEd2023](/exercises/ex0/libraries/SAP_Arrows_TechEd2023.drawio) - Arrows can be used to connect the different entities in your solution diagram<br>[SAP_Basic_Shapes_TechEd2023](/exercises/ex0/libraries/SAP_Basic_Shapes_TechEd2023.drawio) - Basic Shapes to create your layers and boxes for your solution diagram <br>[SAP_Numbers_TechEd2023](/exercises/ex0/libraries/SAP_Numbers_TechEd2023.drawio) - Numbers following the design guidelines for solution diagrams for SAP BTP
6. Import the libraries in the opposite order of how they are mentioned in step 5. To do so click on "File"->"Open Library from"->Device (Alternatively from the storage type you are using). Import Numbers first. Repeat the import for Shapes, then Arrows, Generice Icons and finally Service Icons. If everything went according to plan your left pane in draw.io should look like this (after pulling it out to the middle):

## Mental preparation - Reading the Guidelines

1.	In addition to a sneak preview of the service icons and the basic shapes we would like to give you a first glimpse at the new solution diagram guidlines. Please note though that this is a sneak preview. Please download the guidelines: <br>[Solution Diagram Guidelines](/exercises/ex0/libraries/BTP_Solution_Diagram_Design_Guidelines_TechEd_SneakPreview.pdf)	

## Summary

In this first preparatory step we imported all the relevant libraries into draw.io and we can now easily build solution diagrams for SAP BTP. Again the libraries as provided here are meant to be used during the exercises only.
