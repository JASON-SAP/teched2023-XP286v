## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called XP286v - SAP Business Technology Platform Solution Diagrams.  

## Overview

Solution diagrams allow you to visualize best practices and architectures of solutions running on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). In turn, this allows you to realize your SAP BTP solutions more easily. Learn how to use the icons, apply the design guidelines, and create your own solution diagrams in the best way.

## Requirements

For the following session all you need is access to draw.io (we will be using the Web client) and the information and files in this repository. Please note: The files provided for this exercise are meant for use as part of the exercises only. They aim to give you a good understanding of the iconography for the SAP Business Technology Platform that we are working on right now.

## Solution Diagrams for SAP Business Technology Platform

Solution diagrams are used by many stakeholders for very different reasons. In general they are an essential tool to communicate the components, the functionality, and the general design of a solution using a visual representation. Using solution diagrams, it is possible to visualize complex solutions in an intuitive way, thereby allowing different stakeholders with different backgrounds to find a common ground to discuss the solutions.

For SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) there is a dedicated set of icons representing the different services of SAP BTP. This session is part of the first phase in taking these icons to the next level by, in addition to updating them, making them available through Open Source.
